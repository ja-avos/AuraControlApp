# Logging Strategy for Aura Control App

## Overview
The logging system in the Aura Control App is designed to provide comprehensive and meaningful logs for both user interactions and app-robot communications. Logs will be stored both locally on the device and in Firebase for centralized access and analysis.

## Logging Levels
1. **Info**: General information about app operations (e.g., navigation events, successful actions).
2. **Warning**: Non-critical issues that do not interrupt the app's functionality (e.g., network instability).
3. **Error**: Critical issues that require attention (e.g., failed SSH connection, unhandled exceptions).

## Logging Components
1. **Local Storage**:
   - Logs will be stored in a local file on the device for offline access.
   - The file will be rotated periodically to prevent excessive storage usage.

2. **Firebase Storage**:
   - Logs will be sent to Firebase Firestore for centralized storage.
   - Each log entry will include metadata such as timestamp, log level, and device information.

## Implementation Details
### Local Logging
- Use the `logging` package to manage log entries.
- Store logs in a file within the app's local storage directory.
- Implement a file rotation mechanism to archive old logs.

### Firebase Logging
- Use Firestore to store logs in a collection named `app_logs`.
- Each log entry will have the following fields:
  - `timestamp`: The time the log was created.
  - `level`: The log level (Info, Warning, Error).
  - `message`: The log message.
  - `metadata`: Additional context (e.g., user ID, device info).

### Log Format
Logs will follow a consistent JSON format:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-05-10T12:00:00Z",
  "level": "Info",
  "message": "User navigated to Settings screen",
  "metadata": {
    "userId": "12345",
    "device": "Pixel 5",
    "networkStatus": "Connected"
  }
}
```

## Integration Points
1. **Navigation Events**:
   - Log every screen transition with the destination screen name.

2. **User Actions**:
   - Log significant user actions (e.g., executing a command, changing settings).

3. **Connectivity**:
   - Log connectivity status changes (e.g., robot connected/disconnected).

4. **Errors**:
   - Log all caught exceptions and errors with detailed stack traces.

## Best Practices
- Use meaningful and concise log messages.
- Avoid logging sensitive information (e.g., passwords, SSH keys).
- Ensure logs are uploaded to Firebase only when the device is online.
- Implement a retry mechanism for failed Firebase uploads.

## Future Enhancements
- Add log filtering and search functionality in the Logs screen.
- Implement real-time log streaming for debugging purposes.
- Integrate with external monitoring tools for advanced analytics.
